## Features

- City-specific data analysis for Chicago, New York City, and Washington
- Temporal analysis (month, day of week, hour)
- Popular station statistics
- Trip duration calculations
- User demographic analysis

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- time

## Data Files Required

The script expects the following CSV files in the same directory:

- `chicago.csv`
- `new_york_city.csv`
- `washington.csv`

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system
2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```

3. Place the CSV data files in the same directory as the script
